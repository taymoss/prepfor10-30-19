        <svg width = 200 height = 200>
        <circle cx="100" cy="100" r="50" stroke="gold" fill="blue"></circle>
        <rect cx="50" x="72" y= "61" width="15" height="30" fill="gold"></rect>
        <rect cx="50" x="112" y="61" width="15" height="30" fill="gold"></rect>
        <ellipse cx="100" cy= "120" rx="30" ry="10" fill="gold"></ellipse>

            <h2> Scales and Why the Are Useful </h2>
        <p>They are functions whose parameters you define. A scale is a mathematical relationship and has no visual output directly.Scales come up with domains and ranges so that graphs don't become overly large. It is useful to visualization because it makes the graphs or whatever you are presenting smaller instead of when new data is added growing exponentially larger. Scales help balance the data to make it more presentable to look at, instead of making the graph ever growing. Also, it helps order the data so that it is easier for the user to read and interpret the graph. </p>
